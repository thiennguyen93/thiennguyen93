# Hi, I'm Thien Nguyen. 👋
I’m a software engineer, a web developer and a content creator based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 
🇻🇳.<br />
I love anything related to programming and web/app development. That is the reason why my career goal is to become a full-stack developer. Some technologies that I enjoy working with are ReactJS, Jamstack, PHP/Laravel and SQL. I am a kind of person who is quick to pick up new skills and willing to learn from the others. Therefore, I am interested in joining innovative teams to learn, to contribute and to improve myself.
